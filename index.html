        <h1>Roblox Hacked by ShadowX</h1>
        <p class="warning">Warning: Roblox has been down since yesterday due to a cyber attack!</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the popular gaming platform Roblox was targeted by a massive cyber attack carried out by a hacker known as "ShadowX." This hacker managed to disrupt the game's main servers, causing a complete shutdown of the platform.</p>
        <p>ShadowX, who is known for previous high-profile attacks, exploited a vulnerability in Roblox's security systems. This has left millions of players unable to access the game, and the company is working around the clock to resolve the issue.</p>
        <p>Roblox Corporation has released a statement acknowledging the attack and assuring users that they are doing everything possible to restore services. However, there is no estimated time for when the game will be fully operational again.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, players are advised to avoid sharing personal information or attempting to access third-party links claiming to fix the issue, as these could be phishing attempts.</p>
        <p>We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as more information becomes available. Stay safe and vigilant!</p>
